## Time and Focus Blocker

This is a Time and Focus Blocker I made with inspiration from [this video](https://youtu.be/ifZWcPXDyFc?si=TV3miPxpziuOf9JA).

This project was made in order to allow me to make a schedule of how 24 hours of my day should look like in order ot make complete use of my time.

There might be far better alternatives to this. I might have even made use of those alternatives. I just wanted to make this to learn and make use of my skills for my own benefit. (OK OK I was just too lazy searching for the alternatives and I wanted to make something cool by myself)

[If I ever complete this project, I'll insert some screenshots here, lol]

You can also make use of it, just clone the repository and open the index.html on your browser.

PS. I would appreciate if you star the repository if you make use of it so that I can know if this project makes a difference.
